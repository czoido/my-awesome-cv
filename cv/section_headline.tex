    I am a creative, self-motivated and proactive person who is always looking for new challenges. I love Software Development and always find myself looking for new tools and methodologies.
    Not only am I a fast learner of any programming language or development tool, I also have the ability to obtain quality solutions and objectives for customersâ€™ problems in my domain areas, design and development. 
    My professional characteristics include being an easygoing person, strongly dedicated to my work with the adaptability of working individually, as well as on a team.
