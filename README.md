=================

**My Awesome CV** is based on **YAAC: Another Awesome CV** that was Itself first based on a CV template from Alessandro Plasmati. 

More informations about the original YAAC: Another Awesome CV can be found here : [ https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv ](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv)
   
I changed some styles and added bibliography support for more academic oriented cv's. I also Dockerized the project to run through an Ubuntu container with all LATEX dependencies.
